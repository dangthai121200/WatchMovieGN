- In Java, memory management is the process of allocation and de-allocation of objects,
called Memory management. Java does memory management automatically.
Java uses an automatic memory management system called a garbage collector.
Thus, we are not required to implement memory management logic in our application.
Java memory management divides into two major parts:
  + JVM Memory Structure
  + Working of the Garbage Collector
- JVM Memory Structure:
  + JVM creates various run time data areas in a heap.
  These areas are used during the program execution.
  The memory areas are destroyed when JVM exits,
  whereas the data areas are destroyed when the thread exits

  + Method Area:
   . Method Area is a part of the heap memory which is shared among all the threads.
   It creates when the JVM starts up.
   It is used to store class structure, superclass name, interface name, and constructors.
   The JVM stores the following kinds of information in the method area
    > A Fully qualified name of a type (ex: String)
    > The type's modifiers
    > Type's direct superclass name
    > A structured list of the fully qualified names of super interfaces.
